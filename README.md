# Construction Site Snag Detector

## Overview

The Construction Site Snag Detector is a powerful tool built using Python, Gradio, and the Groq platform. It leverages AI to automatically detect defects, unfinished work, and quality issues in construction site images and videos. This solution aims to enhance quality control and project management by providing real-time insights and expert analysis.

## Features

- **Multi-file Support**: Upload multiple images and videos for batch processing.
- **Real-time Analysis**: Get immediate results for uploaded files without waiting for long processing times.
- **Expert Insights**: Detailed reports generated by an AI assistant specializing in construction site snag detection.
- **Interactive Chat**: Engage in real-time discussions with the AI assistant to clarify findings and ask follow-up questions.
- **Customizable Reports**: Download comprehensive reports for record-keeping and future reference.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python packages (`requirements.txt` provided below)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/construction-site-snag-detector.git
   cd construction-site-snag-detector
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set the `GROQ_API_KEY` environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the application, simply run the main script:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will launch a Gradio web interface where you can interact with the Construction Site Snag Detector.

## Usage

1. **Upload Files**:
   - Go to the "Upload Files" section and select one or more images or videos of your construction site.

2. **Detect Snags**:
   - Click the "Detect Snags" button to initiate the analysis.

3. **View Results**:
   - The analysis results will be displayed in the chat area. Each file's results will be shown separately.

4. **Engage with the AI Assistant**:
   - Ask questions about the detected snags or request additional information directly within the chat interface.

5. **Download Report**:
   - Once you're satisfied with the analysis, click the "Download Report" button to save a comprehensive report for your records.

## Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Frontend**: Built using Gradio for a user-friendly interface.
- **Backend**: Utilizes Python for file handling, image processing, and AI analysis.
- **AI Integration**: Leverages the Groq platform for AI inference, enabling real-time analysis.

### Dependencies

The project relies on several libraries, including:

- `gradio`: For creating the interactive web interface.
- `PIL`, `opencv-python`, `numpy`: For image processing.
- `base64`: For encoding images.
- `logging`: For logging errors and debugging information.
- `tempfile`: For generating temporary files.
- `groq`: For interacting with the Groq platform.

These dependencies are managed via `requirements.txt`.
